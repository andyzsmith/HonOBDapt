<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Prototype</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>HonOBDapt translates requests for
on-board automotive computer sensor data from an ISO standard OBD II
format to a Honda proprietary format used in 92-95 Honda Civics.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>HonOBDapt uses a general purpose
microcontroller module equipped with external digital I/O ports, the
Arduino Uno Rev. 3.  HonOBDapt uses a Freescale MC33660 ISOLink logic
level converter integrated circuit to electrically connect the OBD II
signal line to the Arduino.  HonOBDapt software is written in C++ and
uses the SoftwareSerialWithHalfDuplex library.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>HonOBDapt supports core interactive
diagnostic functionality of the OBD II standard, comprised of
essential sensor data including: air and coolant temperature, spark
advance, fuel injector pulse width, exhaust gas oxygen content,
engine speed (RPM), short and long term fuel trim, fuel system status
(open or closed loop), manifold barometric pressure, atmospheric
barometric pressure, throttle position, vehicle speed, etc.  There is
also a basic capability of translating check engine diagnostic
trouble codes (DTCs).  There is no support for obtaining OBD II
freeze frame data, nor any analog to the concept of continuous fuel
status, EVAP system or misfire monitoring.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>These limitations notwithstanding
this adapter serves a crucial purpose in allowing 92-95 Honda Civics
to be diagnosed with modern, readily available OBD II diagnostic
scanners.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>A prototype was constructed with the
following: several trips to the junkyard to buy a Honda on board
computer (ECU) and OBD II standard connectors, lots of hot glue and
some mild eyestrain from trying to solder the MC33660, which is
manufactured only in a package intended for automated assembly.  The
prototype was tested with an ELM compatible Bluetooth OBD II scanner.
 The prototype was tested with the OBD II PC software packages
Scantool and OBDAutoDoctor.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Asynchronous processing unit design</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Generally, classes involved in handshaking and
serial communications support Work(), DoneWorking() and Reset().</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>These functions serve as a basic
cooperative multitasking system.  Work() is called when a higher
level controller has a time slice to give to the unit.  The Work()
function of each controller is expected to do its' work, and exit
quickly.  If the conditions are met that allow the handshaking or
communications to proceed to the next higher level, DoneWorking()
should return true.  Reset() is used to reset the internal state of
the unit, typically at the end of a logical session controlled by a
higher level controller.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Generally, the units are one-shot
triggers.  If, for example, a unit is falsely triggered to initiate a
particular process ( by noise or an invalid packet ), it will
continue to attempt completion of the process and cannot properly
proceed with a valid sequence until it is Reset() by a higher level
controller.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Main Event Loop</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The main event loop cycles through
the upper lever coordinators, BusCoordinator, CommCoordinator and
HondaCommCoordinator in a round robin fashion, calling .Work() and
checking .DoneWorking() on each one.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The OBD II port requires a bus
initialization handshaking sequences.  No bus initialization is
necessary on the HondaPort.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The main event loop strives to move
the system into higher and higher levels of functioning.  The macro
levels of functioning are:</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 1. OBD II bus not initialized</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 2. OBD II bus initialized,
waiting for incoming request from the OBD II port.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 3. Message received from the
OBD II port and forwarded to the HondaPort, waiting for message from
HondaPort</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 4. Message received from the
HondaPort and forwarded to the OBD II port.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Once the functioning level reaches 4,
the process restarts generally at level 2, but possibly level 1.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 1.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The main event loop maintains a state
variable that is either NO_COMM or COMM_ESTAB.  Each time through the
main event loop, if the state is NO_COMM (bus not initialized), then
BusCoordinator.Work() is called.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The BusCoordinator will work to
initialize the OBD II bus and achieve a higher state, COMM_ESTAB, by
using TryReady, BusInit, GenericBusInitAttempt and
GenericBusInitComplete.  After the call to BusCoordinator.Work(),
BusCoordinator.DoneWorking() is checked.  If this function returns
true, then the bus is ready for communications and the state is set
to COMM_ESTAB. if DoneWorking() is not true, the main event loop
restarts, again attempting to raise the functioning level by
successfully initializating the OBD II bus.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 2.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Once the bus is initialized,
CommCoordinator.Work() will be called to try to continue to raise the
processing level.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>CommCoordinator will use
GenericCommMessageCollector to get any incoming data on the OBD II
port.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>If there is no data available
immediately on the serial port, the
GenericCommMessageCollector.Work() will exit immediately; this allows
the CommCoordinator to exit and yield control to the main event loop.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>If there is waiting data, the data
will be retrieved and a state of COLLECT will be marked internally to
GenericCommMessageCollector.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>During the next iteration through the
main event loop, CommCoordinator.Work() will be called and the Work()
function will call GenericCommMessageCollector.Work().  If there is
more data available on the OBD II port, that data will be collected
by the GenericCommMessageCollector.  Since the internal state of
GenericCommMessageCollector is COLLECT, the new data will be appended
to the existing message buffer.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 3</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>A true return value from
GenericCommMessageCollector.DoneWorking() signifies that a complete
and valid OBD II message has been received and the internal state of
the coordinator, CommCoordinator, will be marked as MESSAGE_RECEIVED.
 Then the GenericCommMessageProcessor will become active, processing
the request by calling HondaHandler.IncomingPID().  The HondaHandler
will translate the OBD II PID to an appropriate request for Honda
data and will call SendHondaRequest() to send a command sequence to
the HondaPort.  HondaHandler will then assign the request to the
HondaCommCoordinator, which queues the request, using a function
pointer to establish a non-blocking asynchronous callback to be
executed when the HondaPort data is ready.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>CommMessageProcessor and
CommCoordinator then yield control to the main event loop.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>During the next iteration of the main
event loop, HondaCommCoordinator.Work() will be called and the
HondaCommCoordinator will pick up the queued request and set an
internal state of WORKING.  The HondaCommCoordinator will use the
HondaCommMessageCollector to get any incoming data on the HondaPort. 
If there is waiting data, the character data will be retrieved and a
state of COLLECT will be marked internally in the
HondaCommMessageCollector</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>DUring the next iteration through the
main event loop, HondaCommCoordinator.Work() will be called.  If
there is more data, that data will be collected by the
HondaCommMessageCollector.  Since the internal state of
HondaCommMessageCollector is COLLECT the new data will be appended to
the existing message buffer.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 4</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>When the message from the HondaPort
is complete and valid, signaled by the HondaCommMessageCollector
returning true to DoneWorking(), the HondaCommMessageProcessor will
become active and process the message by executing
HondaHandler.Callback().  HondaHandler.Callback() will execute the
appropriate return function matching the original asynchronous
request and effect the translation of the Honda sensor data into ISO
measurements, using a member of the group ISOMeasurementsTOISOReply,
and the reply to the OBD II port, using a GenericHandler.IISOReply
family member.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>At this point the overall state has
reached its highest point of productivity.  The various
MessageCollector(s) and MessageProcessor(s) are reset, and the main
event loop restarts at level 2, waiting for more serial messages from
the OBD II port.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>-- Advantages of state controller
design</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>---Extensibility</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>This structure provides a clean,
clear implementation that lends itself to further modifications and
extension, such as hooks to process other data or timeout watchdogs,
because there are clear places to hook into the overall flow of
handshaking or messaging without the risk of undesirable interaction
or needing to understand the lower level operation of each
controller.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>This structure also provides a clean
way to implement potentially deep nested logic in a clear, easy to
debug and trace fashion.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Each asynchronous unit is coded with
the overall structure in mind.  For example, TryReady.Work() will not
block but will do a small amount of work, polling the OBD II K-Line
bus status and checking the time-of-day ( millis() ) to maintain a
running total of idle time and then Work() will exit.  TryReady can
maintain internal state such as the running total but encapsulates
that state and signifies that internal conditions have been satisfied
by returning true to DoneWorking().  Also, when logical conditions
require, Reset() can be used to reset the running total.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>In this way serial communications or
handshaking can be carefully controlled from the upper level.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>For instance, this structure makes it
easy and clear to implement an *OVERALL* handshake attempt timeout,
without modifying functionally distinct units such as TryReady.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>---Error Handling</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>When dealing with serial port
messaging, subject to noise, message fragments being received, etc, </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>it is quite possible for individual
functional units to become stuck or hung due to: waiting for message
termination or validation that will never succeed because of
mid-message corruption, invalid or nonstandard messages, etc.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>In this type of messaging environment
it is important to maintain supervisory control with clear top-down
control logic.  The asynchronous, non-blocking Work(), DoneWorking()
pattern lends itself to implementing supervisory controls.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Of paramount importance is that the
supervisory code and its' interface to lower level code be clear,
distinct and concise, so that unforseen situations; i.e. dealing with
slightly altered or new packets or protocol details and their
concomitant issues; can be dealt with effectively.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>---Complexity and correctness</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>The factoring of complicated nested
communications logic into a body of state machines is an effective
way of managing complexity and makes logical defects more apparent. 
This factoring methodology allows the program to be treated as the
steps of an algorithm, facilitating the application of mathematically
rigorous techniques to prove or disprove the correctness of the
program logic.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>-- Possible ramifications of state
controller design</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Although the event loop design of the
serial communications code has additional overhead compared to a more
direct low-level approach, and can cause an entire event loop to be
executed between individual serial character data retrievals, the
overhead is mostly syntactic exposition, and is not expected to be
computationally intensive.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">As well, 9600 baud is not particularly fast
relative to Arduino's microprocessor speed and the SoftwareSerial
library is interrupt driven ( interrupts take priority over all other
execution context ) and SoftwareSerial maintains its' own input
buffers.  Also, the direct serial controllers, CommMessageCollector
and HondaCommMessageCollector are enhanced with a burst mode that
increases their priority under certain circumstances.  Due to these
factors it is considered extremely unlikely for the overhead of the
state machine control system to cause a loss of serial data on any
port.</P>

<P CLASS="western">establishes generic requirements for a bus
initialization attempt, which begins the handshaking sequence of an
OBD II session.  Uses WAKE_PACK array, a storage area for K-Line bus
pin logic level transition times ( 10ms, 100ms, etc ).  This routine
uses Arduino's digitalRead to check the logic level of the OBD II
K-Line bus pin.  When the pin alters state ( High to Low or Low to
High ) the time-of-day ( millis() ) is recorded.  This recorded value
is compared to the time-of-day when the next level transition occurs,
and in this way the length of the handshaking pulse or pulses is
established.</P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Loose Coupling</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Even though they work closely
together to accomplish the overall goal in this adapter
implementation, </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>there is a loose-coupling between the
CommMessageProcessor, receiving a PID from the OBDII port and the
HondaHandler, effecting a reply to the OBD II port.  This coupling is
loose because the Handler could be implemented in different ways and
this loose coupling leaves the door open for more diverse
interpretations of the term 'handling'.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>In this adapter implementation the
loose coupling make it easier to inject an asynchronous handler into
the design.  The CommMessageProcessor is coupled only to an IHandler,
an interface definition ( aka, contract specification ), not tied
directly to the asynchronous implementation of HondaHandler, reducing
the chance of cascading changes rippling through multiple functional
units.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>One of the advantages of the loose
coupling in this adapter implementation is its' ability to mitigate
the situation where one subsystem is blocked by another.  It would be
undesirable to make the CommMessageProcessor block(wait) for the
Honda data to be retrieved. The data may never come but we still want
the CommMessageProcessor to be able to degrade gracefully and respond
to its' immediate supervisor.  The loose coupling supports this
because the HondaHandler doesn't take control when it is tasked with
getting Honda sensor data.  It is delegated to do so and this is a
pattern of Chain of Responsibility, but the CommMessageProcessor
maintains control and can exit cleanly.  This clean exit facilitates
the placement of supervisory control logic where it belongs; at a
high logical level in the code, not buried deep in the implementation
details of a particular low level unit.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Loose coupling has its benefits and
downfalls.  Loose coupling allows flexibility in implementing the
Handler without changing the CommMessageProcessor, and ultimately
aids in the implementation of an asynchronous handler, but this does
not come without issues.  For example, there is no way to easily
enforce transactional integrity across this coupling, or pass error
or control messages such as 'retry' across this coupling because by
the time a failure is detected on one side of the coupling, the
execution context that initiated the request has exited.  A similar
problem occurs with non-asynchronous loose coupling, where, for
example, it is impossible to pass an error message because the loose
coupling only supports a limited interface.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>--- Benefits</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Factoring out distinct conceptual
groups of functionality like sensor data virtual function interface,
	ISOMeasurementsTOISOReply grouping, IISOReply and GenericISOReply
provides the flexibility of modularity.  		Individual pieces can be
swapped in and out, e.g. substituting a newer Controller Area Network
diagnostic 	subsystem implementation for the OBD II system, as long
as the new piece adheres to the established 		convention, defined by
interfaces.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Flexibilty means less risk. 
Generalizing may take more front-end design time, but reduces the
amplitude of wild-schedule swings on the back end.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>--- Ramifications</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Compositional reuse can lead a design
down a dead end.  If a class inherits everything from a composed
class and implements a new subsystem, without a solid set of abstract
interfaces ( or contracts ) to define exactly where in the tree the
new functionality branches off from ( or differs from the previous
incarnation ), it is likely that new functionality will simply
rewrite existing functionality.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>So there is a place on the spectrum
between strict inheritance hierarchy-to-god class compositional
multipurposing that must be chosen carefully.  Too tight interface
adherence limits the diversity that future implementations can
create.  Too little interface adherance and excessive use of ad-hoc
compositional reuse encourages rewrites and big-ball-of-mud designs.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Overgeneralization</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The attempt to use generic structures is a noble
goal, but there is a limit to how far to take it.  The architect of
class families must focus on the real purpose of the design effort. 
Is it to solve a particular problem, with a flexible building block
pattern, that reduces the risk that changing requirements will render
the code unusable?  
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Or is the design effort moving
dangerously toward overgeneralization.  For example, a good home
builder might carry a variety of tools, saws, hammer, etc, some of
which may even be used to build other tools. e.g. scaffolding for
painting.  But the home builder doesn't carry a smelting forge in the
truck.  He doesn't need that much generality and to attempt such
would actually be counterproductive - for building a house - so the
principle is to keep some perspective about the goal you are trying
to achieve.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Too much factoring and generalizing
can cause unnecessary complexity.  As the class family becomes more
fragmented and modular it becomes harder for the consumer to
understand how to use it.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>So the place on the spectrum of
generalism-to-specialization is important.  There is always a design
trade-off.  As Spolsky says, the trash can must be open on top so
people can put trash in.  But it needs to be closed on top so trash
doesn't blow away.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>is constructed with inheritance and
composition.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The HondaHandler inherits
functionality from the trunk, GenericHandler.  But GenericHandler is
actually formed of inheritance from IGenericHandler and IHandler, but
also of composition with another family tree, IISOReply.  So the
trunk HondaHandler inherits is already a compositional mixture and
not a strict inheritance hierarchy of 'is a' relationships.  The
mixing of the ISOMeasurementsTOISOReply functions and an IISOReply
family member into the IHandler family hierarchy effectively
constrains handlers derived from GenericHandler to being OBD II-based
handlers.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>HondaHandler is also formed with a
mix of inheritance and composition; inheriting from GenericHandler
but also formed by being composed with IGenericAsyncHandler.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>In principle, if the classes form a
definite tight hierarchy and really could not be split into separate
pieces that are independently functional, use inheritance.  Another
rule of thumb is if the relationship is a direct building *upon* ,
use inheritance.  If the relationship is a kind of association with,
or equal level partnership, use composition.  If the classes could be
split, use a composition approach to achieve the right mix of
'lateral' building blocks.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The GenericHandler is made concrete
on the OBD II side and left abstract on the Honda side because this
is the most likely usage pattern.  The next logical step for the
IHandler family tree would be to branch off at the GenericHandler
level to create a concrete implementation of another proprietary
standard that needed to adapt to the now ubiquitious OBD II standard.
 This is a likely re-use pattern, but not the only one afforded by
the generalization topology described here.  It is hard to
conceptualize exactly what could be constructed with the existing
modules and interfaces ( or contracts ) but that is the beauty of
infrastructure in the designer's opinion.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western">The implementation of IHandler.IncomingPID() by

<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>GenericHandler is a mediator because
it is the only class that knows the internal details of two systems:
the OBD II system and the Honda system.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>From the perspective of the
CommMessageProcessor, the IHandler base interface presents a
simplified interface to the Honda side that consists of only one
function call, IncomingPID.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>From the perspective of the Honda
side GenericHandler presents a simplified interface to the OBD II
side that consists of a group of ISOMeasurementsToISOReply...XXXX
reply functions.  The input and operation of these functions is well
defined and simple.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Thus the GenericHandler serves as a
mediator, providing a simplified interface to a complex task of
obtaining Honda sensor data as well a providing a simplified
interface to a complex task of sending data to the OBD II port using
the proper protocol, mediating these two sides of the system.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Software Serial</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The SoftwareSerial library was chosen
for two reasons.  The Arduino only has one hardware serial port, and
the best use for this port is as a debugging aid to see the trace
messages from the monitor.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The other reason is that there is a
need to operate the serial port at a non-standard Honda baud rate. 
The serial timing in SoftwareSerial.h was adjusted, though minimally,
for 9470 baud.  The original timing for 9600 baud worked before these
adjustments were made.  This baud rate is relatively low and the
difference between the Honda rate and the standard rate is small, so
it is possible these timing adjustments are superfluous.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Due to the nature of the
SoftwareSerial interrupt driven design, only one serial port can be
active at any time.  Therefore, at precise junctions in the control
structure, each port is activated with a .listen() statement.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>Half Duplex. This section is
unconfirmed and based on the best knowledge of the designer.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>SoftwareSerialWithHalfDuplex is used
because the communication line on the Honda Diagnostic Link Connector
is half duplex, that is, only one member, the client (HonOBDapt) or
the server (on board computer, ECU) can transmit data at one time. 
SoftwareSerialWithHalfDuplex supports this configuration by
specifying the same pin for Transmit and Receive.  It is the
responibillty of the HondaCommCoordinator to enforce this constraint,
as the behaviour of SoftwareSerialWithHalfDuplex if an attempt is
made to transmit and receive at the same time is unknown.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The OBD II ISOPort is also half duplex, but is
connected to the MC33660 which has a full duplex style of connection
with both Receive and Transmit pin connections.  This provides a
physical, electrical way of enforcing half duplex on the OBD II
K-Line, as a communications participant attempting to bring the line
low or high while the other participant is still transmitting will
simply be ignored by the circuitry in the MC33660.</P>

<P CLASS="western"><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>MC33660 is a level conversion
integrated circuit that converts 5 volt logic signals to 12 volt
logic signals.  This is necessary because the main hardware
component, the Arduino, uses 5 volt signals on its' digital I/O pins
and OBD II specifies 12 volt signals.  MC33660 is an integrated
circuit specifically designed for logic level conversion in an OBD II
automotive application and should therefore be particularly suited to
this application in terms of susceptibility to noise, overload
protection, etc.  MC33660 is designed to be connected to the K-Line
bus and therefore provides an appropriate electrical interface for
serial communications and bus-style level transitions.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Arduino</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Arduino provides 5 volt logic level digital I/O
pins that are suited to this application.  The application of a
software library that allows serial communications on any pin
provides significant flexibility.  Arduino has flexible power supply
requirements and can be operated on a 12 volt system.  Nominal
current draw through the onboard voltage regulator in this
application is 200mA.  Heat created by the voltage regulator dropping
12 volts to 5 volts to power the on board processor is dissipated by
a small on-board heatsink, so the current limits and supply voltage
combination must be carefully selected.  The current configuration is
within limits to the best knowledge of the designer and has been
anecdotally confirmed by feeling for excess heat from the voltage
regulator.</P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>The OBD II electrical and logical

This adapter supports the K-Line standard(s) of ISO-9141,
ISO-14230_slow, and ISO-14230_fast.  Only one is technically required
as any OBD II compliant scanner must be able to work with all three,
but the implementations vary only minimally and provide a good
exercise and example of certain software design techniques.</FONT></P>
